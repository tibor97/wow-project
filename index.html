					<h4 class="u-text-divider-bottom__red">WHAT IS AN "AFFIX"?</h4>
					<p class="u-white">An affix is a modifier applied to a mythic keystone at set levels. Different combinations occur every week, with the combinations eventually repeating on a set schedule</p>

				<div class="l-content-container-wrapper">
					<h4 class="u-text-divider-bottom__red">EXPLAINING AFFIX DIFFICULTY?</h4>
					<p class="u-white">Affix difficulty ratings are crowdsourced, meaning they are assigned a difficulty based on user feedback. I will be rolling out a new survey when we've seen more of the affixes and how they play in the new dungeons.</p>

				<h3>LEVEL 4 AFFIXES</h3>
				<div class="c-square-divider"></div>
				<p class="u-italic">(ONE AFFIX WILL OCCUR AT +4 PER WEEK)</p>
				<div class="c-cards">
					<div class="c-cards--card">
						<h5 class="u-hidden">Hidden title</h5>
						<p class="u-text-divider-bottom__orange paragraf__padding">Non-boss enemies will buff nearby allies' health and damage when defeated with a 30yd effective range.</p>
						<p class="u-small-paragraf u-italic">Note: it's important to kill all the trash in a pull as closely together as possible with this affix as mobs effectively heal as they gain max health (percent translation). Adds spawned from a trash mob or boss ability do not trigger bolster. It's possible to reset bolster on mobs by resetting them via wiping or exiting combat.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c-cards--card">
						<h5 class="u-color-orange">Raging</h5>
						<p class="u-text-divider-bottom__orange">Non-boss enemies will enrage at low health, dealing double damage until killed.</p>
						<p class="u-small-paragraf u-italic">Note: mobs with high damage targeted abilities or high damage AoE abilities become deadly with this affix. Be sure to focus fire mobs down so there aren't multiple enraged mobs at once.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c-cards--card">
						<h5 class="u-color-green">Sanguine</h5>
						<p class="u-text-divider-bottom__green paragraf__padding ">Shortly after death, non-boss enemies will leave a pool of blood on the ground, which grows to a 5yd radius over 2 seconds. This pool heals enemies and damages players for a % of their maximum health. The pool's radius is 8 yds.</p>
						<p class="u-small-paragraf u-italic">Note: While this affix was mostly ignorable before, it has become a problem in some of the new close-quarters dungeons. In addition, there are a lot more caster-style mobs that will sit in the pools. Mass grips/knockbacks are valuable in Sanguine keys..</p>
					</div>
					<div class="c-cards--card card-border card-border__orange">
						<h5 class="card-border--title u-color-orange">Teeming</h5>
						<p class="u-text-divider-bottom__orange paragraf__padding">Additional non-boss enemies are present throughout the dungeon; kill count requirement increased.</p>
						<p class="u-small-paragraf u-italic">Note: Not much different from usual unless paired with other problematic affixes (Skittish). The most notable change with this affix is that the Enemy Forces Defeated kill requirement is increased. Certain trash pulls can be really nasty with this affix depending on the dungeon.</p>
